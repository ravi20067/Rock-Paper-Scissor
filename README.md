  Players can click on their choice — rock, paper, or scissors — to play against the computer.  
  The game visually displays both selections using custom images and determines the winner.

- **Visual Elements**  
  Each choice (rock, paper, scissor) has dedicated graphics for clarity.  
  Instruction prompts guide user interaction.

- **Game Logic**  
  Implemented in `script.js` using JavaScript to:
  - Detect player's selection
  - Randomly generate computer's choice
  - Compare and declare results (win, lose, or tie)
